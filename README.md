## Overview
### Description
An instagram-like social media app that allows universities/colleges and their enrolled students to host/post pictures and information relating to their campuses for 
interested and prospective applicants.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Education / University / Colleges
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users information, such as location, intended majors/minors, financials, personal interests such as scholarships or financial aids, etc., and connects them to matching colleges and universities.  Colleges and universities can control information and media contents posted on their page, and enrolled students can share their experiences on the school's page with permissions from the administrators.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how much they want to learn about their interested/intended colleges/universities, what exactly they're looking for, and if they find the information posted on the school's page helpful.  Colleges/Universities can also edit/change information and media contents on their page as they desire and use the app to advertise and introduce their schools as much as they want or find it helpful.  
- **Scope:** First we would start with matching users to their universities/colleges, then perhaps this could evolve into an experience sharing application as well to broaden its usage in which students can directly connect and socialize with some enrolled students at their matching universities/colleges.
